# Deploying Kubernetes resources with terrafom 

Deploying Kubernetes resources using Terraform isn't incredibly common. 
Many use Helm or other Kubernetes tools instead. 

Provisioning more resources:
A t2.micro or t3.micro instance doesn't have enough resources to deploy more than one pod. 
Even with only one pod deployed, the node can become unstable very quickly.

This will be just an written guide

## Create a new workspace in tf cloud dashboard
1. Create a new organization
2. Copy CLI remote run code into your provider 
3. Change setting from remote to local
4. Login and setup the provider file

## Actual setup
1. Using a template to create nodered k8
2. setup locals file that provisions 3 deployments of nodered, influxdb, granfana
3. main.tf file makes use of the locals with for_each

## remote state
Why? 
pulling yaml file remotely 
no need to manually specify config_path in the k8s provider
